<p>The newest house in the data isn't that new. A few possibilities:
1. They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.
2. The data were collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the second option is more likely. The contradiction between the first and second option would be clearer if we take a look at the percentile on the ""YearBuilt"" feature. The range between min and 25% is <strong>82 years</strong>. On the other hand, the range between 25% and 50% is <strong>19 years</strong>, between 50% and 75% is <strong>27 years</strong>, and between 75% and max is <strong>10 years</strong>. These data descriptions show that, throughout the years, there is a massive growth in house building in Iowa(There are many more house building between 1954 up to 2010 compared to 1872 up to 1954). It seems illogical or unlikely if the massive growth abruptly stops. So it takes me to the conclusion that the second option is the right one.</p>

<p>Is it a problem? I think it depends on what are the purposes of your analysis. If you are using only the data to predict or describe the recent condition of Iowa real-estate, it's not a good move clearly. But if you are using the data for studying the past of Iowa real-estate, the data are still valid surely but don't forget about the boundaries and limitations of the data.    </p>

<p>Based on the data, re: the newest house in your data isn't that new.</p>

<pre><code>- They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.
</code></pre>

<p>Intuitively you might say ""that's very unlikely"", but I don't think the data supports this, primarily as it makes the assumption that the data was collected in a large area. If the data was collected in a small area, say a single street, then a 10 year interval would seem very likely (reinforced by the intervals that we see in the data). Further, take a look at the characteristics of the houses; aside from the two big outliers, there's no decks, porches, etc. This suggests a common architecture possibly, reinforcing the notion that these houses are in the same area. Ultimately it looks like there's one really old house on a smaller lot that hasn't seen a facelift in a long time, some more recent houses that share many of the same characteristics, and a new sort of super-house that tips the norm heavily based on lot area, price, etc. Throw out the two outliers and you have a fairly uniform build, again suggesting to me this is data from a single small street/area. </p>

<p>-The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</p>

<p>Based on the answer above, this data may have been collected yesterday for all we know. What I would suspect is missing, is renovation data (see below...)</p>

<ul>
<li>If the reason is explanation #1 above, does that affect your trust in the model you build with this data? What about if it is reason #2?</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I suggest that there is no provable reason (based on the data) that the reason is #1, it would seem to follow we have no reason to believe #2. </p>

<p>The one thing that makes me curious is the unbelievable jump in style and value of the most recent house. What I would expect to see, following that, is a possible increase in value of the rest of the houses (this has become a desirable area), and a whole bunch of new renovation data is likely (since the latest house has all the trimmings). Since the lot areas are all different, it would seem all these houses are unique (not the same one sold over and over), so we could also suggest houses here do not casually flip. </p>

<p>If I was a contractor specializing in renovation, I might be very interested in this street. </p>

<p>I have some other thoughts on the data, but those would be extensions of what we currently have to work with, not real data. </p>",,

<p>I am also new to machine learning but I believe that you can answer such a question by asking yourself, if a successful real estate investor could make such an estimate? As far as I know real estate investors are constantly using the present day data to make their predictions. And we want our model to act like a successful real estate investor.
Also 10 years is quite a long time. There are housing societies thriving today that did not even exist 10 years ago. So, my point is that too many factors might change in such a long period, hence you cannot make a good estimate.</p>",,

<p>Short answer, yes. 
Long answer:
Given the data one *<em>could *</em> make a decent educated guess. Now, given that the value of houses changes over time, based on the year it was built and the area it's in, our guess could be refined to better match the data of a newer, up-to-date, dataset.</p>",3.0,04/04/2020

This could be a possibility as there might be a chance of the area already filled up to the maximum and there is no more space to build new houses.

<p>At first I was thinking it's collected at least from 2010 to now(year of 2020) since the max of year of built is 2010. But after I notice the max of year of sold is 2010, I would like to believe that this data is collected in 2010.</p>

<p>The reason is that if it's collected in a paticular year after 2010, say 2014, but the max of YrSold is 2010, which means from 2010 to 2014 there is no house sold, which is not possible in real world. Maybe someone will defend to say that the trading data from 2010 to 2014 is not collected on purpose, but it doesn't make sense either since if we want to predict the lastest house price, why we prefer older data before 2010 rather than 2014?</p>

<p>Or, you still could say data from 2010 to 2014 is hard to collect, by some reason. But in real world, sicne the data collecting tech is growing rapidly, I can't think of a reasonable explaination that data before 2010 can be collected, but suddenly cannot be collected after 2010.</p>

<p>But the above discussion it's not absulotely true since collecting data costs time, maybe it costs 2 years(say a very long time for discussion), so it finished collecting in 2012. By this case, we of course would not collect any data from 2010 to 2012 because we spend 2 years to collect data till 2010. It's not because people stop building house(reason #1) but just because data collecting time is too long.</p>

- Gather more data about similar elements. Gather periodical data as well as census data, this would help.

If there was a collapse of the economy in the town where this information was gathered, it would skew current trends. Lets say a large farming conglomerate decided to move out of the Iowa town this data was based on in the year 2011. This would mean the economy of the town could collapse enough where no new houses are being built because families have to abandon their homes by the thousands in order to find new work. This housing surplus could mean that not only are people not needing to build new homes, but nobody is moving to a town that has no economic base.</p>

<p>And we can also interpret why the most numbers of houses were built after 2000 and the YearBuilt is drastically dropped since 2006 to 1 in 2010. I think that the recent houses were more likely to be sold and it is the reason of the strange statistics between 2000 and 2010.</p>

As many others have mentioned, the newest home in the data set is nearly ten years old which suggests that data collection has not occurred for some time.  The fact that the dataset only includes 1460 homes over a time span of 148 years tells me that this dataset likely does not include all homes built in Iowa. It most likely represents a subset of the total state.  If this is the case, it is possible that the data is current and no other homes have been built in this area.  To trust the model, it would be critical to also determine why no homes have sold after 2010.</p>

<p><strong>2. The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</strong>
This seems to be the more likely scenario.  The mean tells us that ~10 houses were built each year.  So, it is not very likely that there has not been a single house built since 2010.  If this is the case, I would not trust the model as recent trends may have changed home pricing data, especially given the economic trend during that time (2010 - 2020).</p>

1. The dataset has <strong>not been updated with the latest data</strong>. <br>
1a. It was only meant for teaching and current data is not required.  This data was acquired once only.  <em>This is most likely.</em>
1b. Legally, the data is not available for several years.  Houses <em>have</em> been sold, but we can't see that without acquiring the rights to access that data.
2. <strong>No new houses have been sold</strong> since the last recorded.  This is possible but unlikely.
2a. A catastrophic event may have suddenly ended the housing market (Nuclear meltdown)
2b. Legally, there is a law prohibiting the sale of houses under a certain age.  Perhaps builders in Iowa are not to be trusted ;)</p>

<p>Option 1a is most likely.  All are possible.  We cannot know for sure from the data alone.  You could try analyse the rate of house sales to determine whether it slowed and eventually stopped.  <em>That</em> would be good evidence.</p>

<p>Another way to tell would be to check other sources.  A quick check on the internet shows that houses are still being sold in Iowa, so that eliminates 2a.  It should be simple to determine when those houses were built or whether there is a law prohibiting young-house sales (2b), and finally whether the data is public (1b).  The most likely outcome will be option 1a.</p>

<p>Whether the data gap is a problem depends on how much the market has changed since then.  My first thought is that it should <em>not</em> matter, since I think the housing market usually quite stable.  The features that determine the value of a house should be consistent (#bed, #bath, etc).  Having said that, I do believe that this type of model would be best when trained on the most current data, since market preferences do evolve over time (modern features like data connectivity, etc).

<p>We have total 1460 rows, meaning data of 1460 houses built during 1872 to 2010 (min and max values for 'YearBuilt' column)</p>

Meaning, 50% of total houses in our data were built in just 37 years compared to 101 years for first 50% of total houses.</p>

<p>1872 - 0 houses - 0 year
1954 - 365 houses - 82 years] 
1973 - 365 houses- 19 years] --&gt; 50% of the total houses in 101 years
2000 - 365 houses- 27 years]
2010 - 365 houses- 10 years] --&gt; later 50% houses in just 37 years</p>

<p>So, we can say that, there is no way that they suddenly stopped building houses.</p>

<p>Also, the YrSold is ranging from 2006 to 2010 only.! And there is no loss of data for the YrSold column (count is 1460 i.e. total rows in data). Meaning all the houses listed are already sold between years 2006 and 2010. So, this data might have been collected between end of year 2010 and mid/ end of year 2011 to know details about houses sold between years 2006 and 2010.!</p>

Therefore, it would be safer to assumed that this data was compiled around that year; so it was 10 years old and last updated in year 2010.  Yes, it would be a huge problem to use this outdated data to predict the house price now unless there are other data that could be use to account for 10 years house appreciation rate in that area.

Possible affects. : I think its would very problematic and a tough situation to make predictions as we are not aware how the relationship between price and other variable are after 2010. 
Two cases are possible- a) If the trends is similar from 2010 to 2020 as it was from 2000 to 2010 then we might have 
                                              some chance.
                                           b.) If trends are pretty different for recent data points meaning the trends are not similar from 
                                              2010-2020 as it was in 2000-2010 period, then we should rather stop.
Thus , any assumption as such will lead to wrong answers.</p>

<p>2.) Argument 1 : No houses are built after 2010 
Let's say there is a place where govt is taking action to avoid any kind of new construction hence there is no data after 2010. This would cause another big issue since the constant number of houses will be in huge demand for ever increasing population. But such a case seems rather hypothetical.</p>",,

We could then combine this dataset with other data that might have changed since 2010, such as interest rates. This would allow us to extrapolate from the data and to make at least an educated guess about current prices. Of course, these predictions will only be as good as our assumptions when extrapolating.</p>",,

<p>The model built with these data collected 10 years back is best for predicting the housing price in iowa 10 years back.But if we intend to predict the housing price with same model after 4-5 years, the prediction may fail because of the several factors like market price hike  , added infrastructures in the house and many more.</p>",,

If you take a closer look at columns titles you will notice a column titled with dots (...) and all data under that column also have dots as data (...). will that's obvious its not a column but a note to a hidden columns.

There is no consistent demand and supply, etc. The supply (buyers) from Iowa will go to other places, increasing further the demand (prices) and further skewing the prices up.

<p><strong>AND THE DATA IS PROBABLY TRUE DATA, NOT FAKE TEST DATA</strong></p>

<p>This comment is in support of my previous comment.
<strong>(My previous comment is 6 comments below.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now if you look at the google search for ""Financial Year Iowa""</strong> you get : -
<em>""The state fiscal year runs from July 1 to the following June 30 and is numbered for the calendar year in which it ends. The State of Iowa operates on a modified accrual basis which provides that encumbrances on June 30 must be paid within 60 days after year end.""</em></p>

<p><strong>And it is not the end, Keep it coming;</strong></p>

<p><strong>It turns out on some more research that There were some major Real Estate Reforms in IOWA in JULY 2010</strong></p>

<p>Read this Bros :

<p>State of IOWA had lawsuits against defaulters like in this case record : <br>

<p>So comparing these findings, and the data graph provided by <a href=""/mshariat121"">@mshariat121</a> (which ends JULY 2010)(sort these comments by most upvotes),
<strong>I can reaffirm that this is a real company data that most probably closed in JULY 2010</strong></p>",,
258709,859359,60581,5080851,05/24/2020 11:04:48,,"<p>Option 2 is more plausible considering the information obtainable from the data. Looking at the two other columns with a ""year"" information, the maximum values all end in 2010, meaning that there is no information beyond that year(2010). 
Regarding the accuracy of the model, it would be difficult to give a guarantee because certain factors on which the data was gathered may have changed over the years. I would only trust the model if the key indicators(features) are proven to be fairly constant from then till now </p>",,
258716,856540,60581,3330280,05/21/2020 20:05:52,,"<p>We can see that the latest data in the file is of the year 2010 hence we can say that the data was collected a long time ago, it does affect the trust in the model as there may arise new factors after the year 2010 which must also be kept in mind while buying the estate.</p>",,
259147,849087,60581,4448070,05/15/2020 13:43:06,,"<p>It seems that this dataset is outdated as it is about 10 years old.I feel the data was published long back in 2010 and after that it has yet to update the info. This seems the valid reason since from 2010 suddenly all stopped purchasing homes might not be the case. Even if due to some reason house selling was reduced It cannot be dropped to 0. 
From this dataset we cannot make predictions and analysis for the current scenario cause 10 years is a huge gap and a huge loss of data. Prices and valuations may have changed completely .</p>",,
259535,845748,60581,5074091,05/13/2020 12:06:57,,"<p>Using stale data to predict anything within the context of such a dynamic market like housing seems like a very bad approach. You will struggle to build a successful business on top of it since you’re basing your decisions on an old view of the world. Maybe this is not as bad for other markets/domains though.</p>

<p>You need both old and new data I guess: old data to analyse trends and forecast more accurately, new data to predict data closer to the ‘now’ moment.</p>

<p>The data just feels like it was a snapshot taken at a moment in time and never updated, at least it's more plausible than “there where no new houses/remods/sells made after 2010"".</p>",,
259547,849170,60581,5088065,05/15/2020 14:45:56,,"<p>It doesn't matter where you live in the world, there is always new home or apartment building within the neighborhood. It looks like in this dataset last house was build in 10 years ago. It is highly unlikely that no new house is build within 10 years in Iowa. This is Iowa this is not rural or non human presence area. So we can assume data should collecting is stopped in 2010. Which take us to the next question can we make predictions using these data. I think if we make predictions out of these data they will have low chance of success. Since 2010, economy, building industries, house building technologies all of these had change. That caused change of price. Therefore i think using these data will have low probability of succeed. But these data will be huge help if we combined it with new records or if we are running some kind of research in 2010 housing industries.  </p>",,
259810,863467,60581,5176104,05/27/2020 10:36:28,,"<p>In both the cases, models accuracy will be questionable. If no new houses are built after 2010 and we use the same data to predict the price today, the result would be biased towards 2010. In second case also if the data is collected long time ago then also it would lead to the same problem. 
In think we should have the latest data to predict the price in 2020. If we don't have, then the result would be in accurate. </p>",,
259897,853220,60581,4990738,05/19/2020 03:26:02,,"<p>Yes, I think the same</p>",,
260109,845955,60581,4243915,05/13/2020 13:58:15,,"<p>I also think the response is the point 2, the data was collected a long time ago.
As we can see in the distribution plots attached, it seems the data is an extraction of the houses by the year sold.
From the 2006 until 2010. And also the extraction date seems it was at the middle of the 2010.</p>

260952,857101,60581,5073066,05/22/2020 09:52:30,,<p>Point 2 is more logical. The data is outdated; The latest year in the 'yrsold' column is 2010 which means there was no sale of houses in the last 10 years; The model created with this data would show prices that are not in the range of the current market prices</p>,,
261130,857170,60581,4879724,05/22/2020 11:12:29,,<p>I think the response is point 2. Data is not collected after 2010</p>,,
261135,842794,60581,4818064,05/11/2020 16:23:53,,"<p>Only from looking at the description, we can see that the max for house to be built, sold and remodel done is 2010. So it can be estimated that the data was collected a long time ago. If we were to make a prediction about the house costs, depending on outdated data, the results will not be very reliable.</p>",,
261354,857265,60581,5072553,05/22/2020 13:13:50,,"<p>The data is 10 years old, considering all the houses were sold between 2006-2010. That can be inferred from the min and max values of YrSold in the data.</p>

<p>Logically following the trend, the data is focused on the houses which were sold between 2006-2010; it does not give us a correct picture of the overall scenario in Iowa. I would not trust my data to build a prediction model for use in 2020.</p>",,
261493,846372,60581,4936242,05/13/2020 17:59:19,,"<p>We can find out which option is more likely by exploring other columns in the database that also contain year information:</p>

<ol>
<li>If option #1 (<em>They haven't built new houses where this data was collected</em>) would be true, we would still expect to find more recent data entries in other columns. Even if there would be no new houses built in this area, we would still expect houses to be sold as they change owners.</li>
<li>If option #2  (<em>The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up</em>) would be true, we would expect that our data contains no entries after 2010 for all other columns as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>Columns that contain year entries are 'YearBuilt', 'YearRemodAdd', 'GarageYrBlt' and 'YrSold'. By using <code>home_data[['YearBuilt', 'YearRemodAdd', 'YrSold', 'GarageYrBlt']].describe()</code> we see that these columns contain no entries about houses being remodeled, sold or built, or garages being built after 2010. Therefore, it is very likely that the collected data only contains information until 2010 (option #2).</p>

The newest data is 2010 From the code [home_data.YearBuilt.max()]

264735,858174,60581,3937495,05/23/2020 09:22:09,,"<p>To understand what period the Iowa data of house prices represent and when the data was collected, we examine all columns containing years.</p>

<p>The DataFrame contains 81 columns (<code>home_data.shape</code>). Noticing that some column names with years contain any of {'Year','Yr'}, we select all the columns with years from home_data.columns as follows:
<code>
year_columns = [col for col in home_data.columns if any(y in col for y in {'Year','Yr'})]
print(year_columns)
</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ['YearBuilt', 'YearRemodAdd', 'GarageYrBlt', 'YrSold']</code>
There are four columns with information on year of house construction (YearBuilt), its remodeling (YearRemodAdd), year of garage construction (GarageYrBlt) and year of house sale (YrSold).</p>

<p>Review the summary statistics on these columns:
<code>home_data[year_columns].describe()</code></p>

<p><img src=""https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3937495%2Fe8f7773109b341853ff11b0b12313d37%2FIowa.png?generation=1590224948168587&amp;alt=media"" alt=""""></p>

<p>YrSold ranges from 2006 to 2010. 2010 is also the maximum of other year variables. Thus, the newest house sold in the Iowa dataset dates back to its construction in 2010, the same as its year of sale.</p>

<p>The reason #1 (<em>They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.</em>) is unlikely. Indeed, the data on house prices should be limited to the year of sale. Even if there were no houses built after 2010, then sales would continue on previously built ones and the data would show sales after 2010. To know for sure, one can find data on more recent house sales in Iowa. However, the last year of sale in this dataset is 2010.</p>

<p>One more likely explanation may be that the data was collected in 2010 over the past 5 years, i.e. starting from 2006, which corresponds to the reason #2 (<em>The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</em>) Besides this, it may also be a sample from a more complete database for the period of 2006-2010. In this case, it is still interesting to analyze how the price varies with different characteristics of houses.</p>

<p>There is one weird observation in the dataset where the year of the house remodeling follows the year it was sold:
<code>
home_data_years = home_data[year_columns]
home_data_years[home_data_years['YearRemodAdd']&gt;home_data_years['YrSold']]

<li>The dataset is definitely outdated and can help us in understanding the pricing structure till 2010, but understanding <br>
today's pricing structure could be a bit irrelevant.</li>

<p>Thinking about the options:
<strong>1. They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.</strong>
The last <em>""YearSold""</em> is 2010. Even if new houses were not built, they should have been sold. But again, we have more households now than the number of house records present.</p>

<p><strong>2. The data were collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</strong>
Not just the houses built but the houses sold after 2010 don't appear in this set. So, this is more likely to happen since the last entries in <em>""YearBuilt""</em>, <em>""YearRemodAdd""</em>, <em>""GarageYrBlt""</em> columns are 2010; and The last record for the sold house is from December 2010, have taken in reference the <em>""MoSold""</em> and <em>""YrSold""</em> columns. </p>",,

In Addition, about the 3rd question ""Is that a problem?""
I think, it´s important keep in mind that it depends on the aims of the model, if, for example, we would like to estimate the current value of the houses in that place, then it would be a problem, since the data would be out of date.

What do you think explains this?
the 2nd option
How could you tell if you are right?
the first option cant be true as the newest date in the table in columns (YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, YrSold) is the same date (2010) which is impossible as everyday people born, leave places, come to other places, and this is the nature of our life so the first option is not a logic one.
so the true one is the second
Is that a problem?
yes, of course, because all of us know that everyday the prices change (not exactly) so this will be inaccurate description for the house and in this case one of the two sides will be oppressed the seller or the buyer and in the two cases is bad thing </p>",,

<p>From the columns, YearBuilt and YearRemodAdd, it is clear that the houses are being remodeled.

<li><p>What do you think about the fact that all homes listed in the Iowa data are several years old? What do you think explains this?
I think this is because the data just shows the houses sold in this state, between 2006 and 2010, regardless of whether they are new or used. For this reason there are sold houses whose construction year is 1872 and sold houses whose construction year is 2010.</p></li>
<li><p>How could you tell if you are right?
The data by itself couldn´t guarranty a 100% of certainty, it would be better if I would have at least some metadata. However, the comparison of “Year Built”, “YearRemodAdd” and “YrSold” columns, shows than construction, remodeling and sale of houses included in the data set ended in 2010, which in theory, could be due to 2 reasons: either, a) the registration of the data ended on that year (2010), or b) people stopped building, fixing and selling houses in that year (2010). I think than option a) is more likely than option b).</p></li>
<li><p>Is that a problem?
It depends on the objective of the model, if, for example, you want to estimate the current value of the houses in that state, then it would be a problem, since the data would be out of date. But, if the aim of the model is to know what were the main factors that determined the price of houses between 2006 and 2010, it would not be a problem.</p></li>

As per the data, the latest house built(YearBuilt), remodelled(YearRemodAdd) and sold(YrSold) was in 2010.

<p>But during the course of years when compared to the year 1872, the time period between 2000 and 2010 in which many houses were built and from 2006 many houses were sold. The reason might be the sale price of houses has increased from the year 2006 compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Yes, we might face a problem when we build a model for predicting the sale prices of the houses of older ones and the current ones, my model would make false predictions and mislead me while predicting the current house price as there is a huge difference in prices b/w older ones and the current houses.</p>",,

For me reason #2 seems a more plausible explanation for the fact that all homes listed in the Iowa data are several years old.<br>
<strong>How could you tell if you are right?</strong><br>
Trends in the data show that baying houses is at a faster pace after 2006 which is clearly backed by the rising selling price. This clearly shows that its a popular area for housing projects and justifies reason#2<br>

<p>So if we wanted to predict the price of a house from after 2010, say 2018, there is no data in that time-frame to support that the trend should continue in the same fashion it did prior. One must be cautious when attempting to make predictions like this.  </p>",,

<p>I noticed two things that point out that it's very likely that houses have been built since 2010, even though it's not reflected in the data. First, the tail of YearBuilt suggests that many houses were built in 2009, so the building gap is short. Second, throughout roughly 150 years there are at least 1460 entries to YearBuilt (excluding missing data), which suggests that many houses were built within a single year.</p>

<p>I consider the test data insufficient for a training model because with such density (&gt;1460 entries in ~150 years) building trends can change substantially over 10 years. However, I know nothing about ML and I'm very bad at statistics (for now), so I'll just move on with the course.</p>",,

<p><strong>1. What do you think explains this?</strong>
The file was not updated with data after 2010</p>

<p><strong>2. How could you tell if you are right?</strong>
2010 is 10 years ago now. It is highly unlikely that no new houses have been build since 10 years.</p>

<p>I thought the dataset was from Melbourne Iowa, which is a small town. The population didn't change much in the last 10 years it seems ( 2010 = 830 - 2018 = 811) and in such a small area it could be possible that there is no new building since then.
However:
- The sudden stop after 2010 (as opposed as a gradual decline in new buildings) informs us that something sudden happened and I didn't find any news about a building stop.
- There are also other columns as well that have no dates after 2010, it raises suspicion that the dataset was not maintained after 2010.
- Afterwards i saw that the dataset doesn't seem to be about Melbourne Iowa, but Melbourne, the capital of Australia.
With 5 million  inhabitants it is not possible that nothing happened after 2010
(A quick search online can confirm that for several of the suburbs listed in the dataset had new, remoddeled or sold buildings between 2010 and 2020.)</p>

<p><strong>3. Is that a problem?</strong>
On itself it is not a problem if the data is correct. Depending on what type of analysis we want to make it should be kept in mind and some predictive analysis will not give good results
e.g. If we want to make a predictive analysis for 2020 or later.</p>",,

To add some thoughts (or echo earlier comments I didn't read) regarding the questions asked about trust in a model (assuming the goal with the model is to predict house prices) using the given dataset:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the dataset is up to date, and there haven't been built any new houses since 2010 (explanation #1), that would probably tell us something about the market environment for housing in the given area and the area's demographics (stable population perhaps(?)). In itself, I don't think a lack of new homes in a given area over a period of time (ten years as of this writing), is a good enough argument to call the model untrustworthy. </p></li>
<li><p>If explanation #2 is the reason (dataset is not up to date), then I think the model would lack too much data too accurately predict house prices in 2020, hence not trustworthy. </p></li>
<li><p>Regarding which explanation is more plausible, looking at the ""YrSold""-column reveals that the last sale was in 2010. That there would not be a single sale for ten years seems highly unlikely to me, regardless of how bad the housing market is in a given area. Hence, I'd say, as many earlier commenters, that explanation #2 is more plausible. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is it a problem? Assuming the intention with the model is to predict house prices in 2020 (and beyond), I'd say it's a problem, because you lack years of data. Of course, it all depends on what you're trying to do with the dataset and model. </p>",1.0,07/25/2020

<ol>
<li><p>Considering the first explanation <strong>""They haven't built new houses where this data was collected""</strong>
Lets assume the explanation to be true i.e, <strong>They have built new houses where this data was collected.</strong> But it is highly unlikely or almost impossible that there is no houses sold or remodeled after year 2010.
So our assumption is wrong and the statement <strong>""They haven't built new houses where this data was collected""</strong>  is <strong>false</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Considering the second explanation <strong>""The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.""</strong>
Lets assume the this explanation to be true i.e, <strong>the data was collected long time ago and the data after the publication wont show up.</strong>
And this assumption is in agreement with the data we have . Since no features with year have max value greater than 2010.

</ol>

<p>So our assumption is true and the this explanation is correct.</p>

<p>Now the question is <strong>""Does that affect my trust in the model build with this data""</strong> ?
The answer is yes because holding the second explanation to be true that this data was indeed collected long time ago explains that the present trend of housing price might have changed over the course of 10 years. So this dataset is not reliable to predict house price today might have been reliable for predicting the house prices 10 years ago.</p>

  <p>I am more inclined to # 2. The histogram shows that until about 1910 houses rarely appeared in the city, but year after year their frequency began to increase. By 2010, the frequency of the appearance of houses has become very high (higher than ever). It seems very unlikely to me that they suddenly stopped building houses</p>

<p>This implies that the data record was stopped abruptly. There was no pandemic or health issue such as COVID-19 in 2010 (As stated by a comment in that same post) to stop any production. Or maybe it was another political matter.</p>

Reason 2 is a more reasonable answer: the data was collected till 2010 probably,by looking at the data related to years together (i.e. YearBuilt,YearRemodAdd and YrSold). Additionally, given that the city itself is still ""alive"", the housing market is still active. So, reason 1 is not correct.</p>

<p>For Q2) How does it affect the trust on the model we build on.
Firstly, no matter for R1 or R2, I lack proper insight if the data itself is large enough to be representative sample.

Some populations (systems) change more quickly and more dramatically than others. It is all about representation. If the relationship between variables has not dramatically changed over the past 10 years than we can probably trust any results derived by using this data set more than if the market had changed dramatically over this period. Socio-economic conditions could play an important role in determining or predicting house prices. Many things could potentially change altering socio-economic variables over a 10 year period, economic conditions, immigration, a pandemic, etc. 
So it depends. It is always a good idea to think about changing populations over time when determining whether or not an older data set can still be useful in analysis.</p>",,

- If the reason is explanation #1 (they haven't built new houses where the data was collected) the area might have had some disaster in 2011, for example, a poisonous gas leakage that made people evacuate out of that particular area and the government declares that the particular area is unfit for living for the next 50 years or so. That could also be the reason why the latest remodeling of a house happened in 2010 and the sales have drastically decreased. In my opinion, this would be a problem because the house prices won't be as predicted. However, it must also be noted that this case is rare.
- If the reason is explanation #2 (the data is not up to date) because the latest sale, latest remodeling of a house, etc were in the year 2010, as many others pointed out, the model would make inaccurate predictions. </p>",,

To me it looks like explanation #2 is more realistic – why would the building and the selling of houses stop if the rate of… everything has been going up exponentially last few decades?<br>

<pre><code>All your comments were very useful and I Learnt a lot from each one of your insights. Coming to the problem I take the side of Explanation #2 even though Explanation #1 makes sense from some perspectives. The primary reason for being against Explanation #1 is because there is negligible no of chances for houses not getting sold in a span of 10 years(2010-2020) and also being 50-100 years old unless the condition of the housing market is way too disastrous as said by many of you people. But of course, even that is a negligible aspect.

<p>So coming to Explanation #2 not having sufficient data will cause significant errors in our model and It's not trustworthy to say that the model prices predicted in the year 2020 will be accurate according to the data collected in 2010 and it is not fair enough because there will be changes in almost all the aspects in these 10 years.</p>",,

1) No houses were built after 2010 and the data is updated, this is very unlikely as pointed out by Mr. Swetha, 25% of the houses are built in the last 10 years (Great Analysis BTW :D) but it still can be the case.
2) The data was not updated since 2010
3) the data is updated, more homes were built but only the prices on the dataset were updated.</p>

<p>Is that a problem?
if the first reason is right, there should not be a problem since even if the houses are old, the prices are correct and up to date and the prediction can be accurate.
If the second reason is correct, whether there were houses built after 2010 or not, there will be a problem with the outdated prices and how correct their representation is with the current houses' pricing.
If the third reason is correct, we may still be able to predict the pricing of old houses but we would not know the effect of age on pricing after 2010. We can still figure out a relationship between age and price from houses built in years before 2010 and before but it would not be as accurate as if the new houses were added.</p>",,

<p>An axamination of the time related features (""YearBuilt"", ""YearRemodAdd"", ""GarageYrBlt"") show that they go upto a max value of 2010</p>

<p>This could be a problem if you were planning on using this dataset to predict the current value of a home. The dataset is incomplete (missing data for the last 9 years) and is not reflective of the current market conditions.</p>

From the home_data.describe() :-
        - The minimum and maximum value in year sold is 2006 and 2010 respectively. The minimum value also indicates the data collection was started from year 2006.
    - Data collection was started up-to year 2010. The maximum value in year built is 2010.
    - The maximum value for Year remodeled and Garage year built is also 2010. </p>

<p>Likelihood of 2nd is very high. Therefore, data n be relied to make predictions for year 2011.

<p>With the describe function on the loaded data we can see the summary on years when the houses are built.
The very first house was built on 1872 (as per the available data) and as of 2010 there are 1460 housing properties listed.
From the summary we can see that it took 80 years to build first 365 houses (25%), 49 years to build next 25% of the listed houses, 27 years to build next 25% of the houses and last 25% houses are built in a span of just 10 years.
So, with this rate we should have see many more houses built in next 9 years (till 2019).
But why the last house built (or modified) is of 2010? Possible reasons:
1. The city has reached saturation level where no more houses can be built. But why no one even modified their homes even after 10 years?
2. The city has met with a natural or man made calamity and no one stays in that city after 2010. But then why would anyone want to buy a property there now?</p>

<p><em>1. No new houses have been built in the area.</em></p>

<p>This would depend on the scope for using the data or a resulting prediction model.  If we only wanted to make predictions on the region where we drew the data, then the lack of new houses would not be an issue.  Even if the lack of new houses represented a slump in the local housing market, the data would still be valid for the local area.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we expect to make predictions on the national level, then we would be missing some key information.  Since new houses have probably been built elsewhere, but not here, this would be a biased data sample.  Then again, if we want to make national predictions, the data is biased based on location anyway.</p>

<p><em>2. The data is old.</em></p>

<p>Knowing that the data is old would significantly hurt its credibility.  The housing market tanked in 2008, and this data may have been collected in 2010.  There may have been significant recovery since then, so all prices listed could be wrong by a significant amount.  Inflation would be a missing factor as well.  </p>

<p>We could also be missing out new trends in houses and house pricing.  It could be, for example, that new construction practices improved the quality of houses made after 2010.  And it could be that house pricing has shifted since 2010.  For example, if tax rates went up, or wages stagnated, then people could be less interested in buying bigger houses. Then the relative value of larger houses might drop.</p>

<p>How could you tell if you are right?  Adding further granular feature. like month of sale.  or resale market data if any will help. Both new house market and resale market wont go to 0 abruptly unless there is policy crackdown.

<p><strong>Statement #2: The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</strong></p>

<p>Trusting the model?
Market conditions change quickly over time. For the algorithm I would trust the model but not for the results (predicted values) under today’s conditions. The algorithm is trained on an older dataset, so actually ‘learning’ from what was valid at that time in the past and tries to predict today’s prices based on that knowledge. If, for instance, a big pool was the ‘must have’ feature 9 years ago but it isn’t today, how could the model have had ‘learned’ that from just the old data? So, having a big pool today wouldn’t have the same price impact as in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Statement #3: How could you dig into the data to see which explanation is more plausible?</strong></p>

<p>Just form the data, without other sources, I had a look at how many houses were being built in each year. It was more or less an increasing tendency except the for the crisis years 2008 and after with a decline but not to zero. Therefore explanation #2 is more plausible for me.</p>

If that's really the case I wonder why they have stopped collecting data and how it would affect our predictions to 2019.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the reason was just a random one. Our prediction for 2019 will not reflect the last market changes but would probably still be in the right path.</li>
<li>If back in 2010 there was an anomaly in the market so important that the people collecting the date close their business, that would significantly affect the present situation and our predictions could be drastically wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>We could test some scenarios to discard the possibility of some huge anomaly:</p>

<p><strong>Scenario1:</strong> Iowa run out of space but people still want to leave there. We could expect:
1.  A gradual decrease in the number of constructions year after year. 
2. A price increase as houses become a scarce resource
3. A decrease in house sales. No new houses means we could only buy houses as they get unoccupied</p>

<p><strong>Scenario2:</strong> Iowa approves some law forbidding the construction, reforms or commercialization at 2010
1. A gradual increase of that activity, as people in the business would try to get rid of all their properties before the law is approved</p>

<p><strong>Scenario3:</strong> People lose interest in Iowa and move somewhere else:
1. A sales decrease followed by:
2. A decrease in new constructions</p>

<p>So <strong>Scenario 1</strong> fits better. But there was no increase in prices as I expected. The number of sold houses did not drop either. It did drop in 2010 but because the data was collected only until some point in July.  </p>

<p>The peak of built houses in 2006 and the drop in both <em>built</em> and <em>prices</em> columns reminds me of the real estate crisis of 2007. My guess is this data was being collected by some construction company that run out of business in 2010.</p>

<p>If this is correct the housing effect would have affected mainly the early years after the crisis but it would be ok by now and we could safely go on with our predictions for 2019</p>

<p>So <strong>Scenario 1</strong> fits better. But there was no increase in prices as I expected. The number of sold houses did not drop either. It did drop in 2010 but because the data was collected only until some point in July.  </p>

<p>The peak of built houses in 2006 and the drop in both <em>built</em> and <em>prices</em> columns reminds me of the real estate crisis of 2007. My guess is this data was being collected by some construction company that run out of business in 2010.</p>

<p>If this is correct the housing effect would have affected mainly the early years after the crisis but it would be ok by now and we could safely go on with our predictions for 2019</p>",2.0,10/13/2019

As seen in the statistic summary of the dataset it shows that the highest value

YES. Given the nature of the real estate market it is important to have the latest data in hand for us to make the correct predictions in the future, so to sum it up it will be a problem if the data in hand is not the latest.</p>",,

<p>Why do you think the newest house in the data isn't that new?</p>

<p><strong>Explanation 1 : They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.</strong></p>

<p>Is this is true, then there is no demand of new houses between 2010 - present. Further, there haven't been any house remodeled after 2010 when we look at the column of 'YearRemodAdd'. A closer look of 20th, 50th and 75th quartile shows that there is a demand of housing. Also the explanation that no new houses have been built is unlikely to happen in the real world which questions the credibility of the data whether it can be used to predict the housing prices for the current year. So this explanation is not consistent intuitively with the given data set.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation 2: The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</strong></p>

<p>This explanation sounds more reasonable and intuitive to me as the alternative answer. The data might be missing or the housing data was not collected for the rest of the years. </p>

<p><em><strong>Insights after reading the [analysis and forecast of housing need in Iowa published on 2013]</strong></em>(<a href=""http://publications.iowa.gov/21633/1/FinalAnalysis_66C8A3A2CEA32.pdf"">http://publications.iowa.gov/21633/1/FinalAnalysis_66C8A3A2CEA32.pdf</a>).</p>

<p>One main point discussed in the summary part of the report states that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The amount, type, and cost of housing needed in a community or region is influenced by the size of the
  population, living arrangements of the population (e.g. households), and the ability of households to pay
  for housing. The size of the population, in turn, relates to the size of the regional employment base and
  the opportunities for housing development.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The statement above leads to another question : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Do you think that the features/fields in the Iowa data are sufficient to model the housing prices between 1872 - 2010? If we have the entire data of the houses built from 1872 - present, are the given features sufficient enough to predict the current housing prices?</strong></p>

1. Not necessarily, it gives us a starting point to understand the current trends in the housing market, however, I would caution that growth in housing has increased dramatically since 2010, making the trends obsolete if we are in fact predicting home prices based on metrics. Perhaps adding a scaler would be a way to bring the home prices to current projections if no new information was available.</p>

If this happens:

I see that by the year 2000 we reach the 75th percentile for the houses have been constructed. Moreover, by 2004, we reach 75th percentile for the houses that have been remodeled, i.e. 75% of the houses have been constructed by the year 2000, similarly 75% of the houses have been remodeled by the year 2004.

The high value of SD for prices suggests that there is lot of fluctuation in data (possibly due to outliers). 
To me this indicates that something is affecting the construction activity here. If the construction had been uniform or increasing then we would have seen a smaller SD and dispersed percentile values. That isn't the case here. 
Having said that, should we be using this data? In 2019, may be not. A lot has happened between the years 2000 and 2010 (dotcom bubble, 9/11, real estate bubble, economy collapse). This data will reflect all of that and hence may not represent the current reality accurately. </p>",,

So if we look a the tendency of demand for homes we can see that in the recent last 10 years (2000-2010) there is a big increase in the demand for homes,  and we can look this the 4 columns before mentioned. The mean of YrSold is 2007 so it shows us that in the last years of the dataset we have more house sales and sudden the sales go to zero this show that our idea is relatively correct.</p>

<p>If we look at the mean for each year, we see that the price changes, and this is despite the fact that the mean is very resistant to emissions. This means that people's behavior and the value of money has changed (I wrote about this earlier and called the main cause of this mortgage crisis). That is, the mortgage crisis (2008yr) has changed the cost of money for the purchase of housing (money began to cost more), and therefore, according to the economic law ""cost-supply"", the price has become cheaper. Further, the number of homes sold has decreased slightly, but not critical (perhaps in the last year the data were already poorly sibirat). But what the average price distribution for the year shows is the change in behavior in the housing market, the price dispersion has decreased (39% in 2008yr and 45% in other years), that is, the number of sales in a very cheap category has decreased (mortgage banks have stopped issuing high-risk mortgage loans) and in the most expensive category (this happens during times of crisis) .

It consists of various sources (own savings, borrowed funds of banks, funds from the sale of housing). At the same time, borrowed funds of banks depend on financial instruments that the bank uses in its activities.

On the issue of building houses in Iowa, I can say the following: the construction of houses is governed by the economic law ""supply-demand"" and therefore has some inertia with respect to changes in the financial and debt markets. If we are talking about a financial crisis in the mortgage loan capital market, then a crisis is a drastic change in the rules, a kind of anomaly.

It's a known trend that the world's population has migrated towards urban centers where the economy is much more diverse. It seemed to have started after the housing collapse. Having lived in LA before the recession, I saw a huge boom in population and development since 2010. Local economies in small towns in America were also eroded by globalization and the rise of online giants such as Amazon.com. 
The evolution of the smartphone and apps catalyzed migration because people were able to navigate and share information instantaneously. The smartphone changed the way people shopped by allowing us to compare brick-and-mortar prices with online retailers who had better prices. That catalyzed the erosion of local businesses.
Another factor worth noting is the opioid epidemic that plagued small town America directly resulted in a heroin and fentanyl epidemic. Such factors turned middle class small town America into unfavorable places to live in. Thus contributing to the decline in housing prices. </p>",,

This will be a problem when drawing certain conclusions about this real-estate market in this neighborhood. If we are tasked with answering questions like ""What price a good price to sell my home in 2019?"" we may not be able to give a good answer since we only have antiquated data.

<p>For me the reason must be ""Houses not being built for a long time"". Here's why, If you do a bar plot of Sale Price against
Year Built. You would find an exponential decrease in the sale price. Although an exponential decrease in sale also happened in 1885-1886. But it's too old to consider. And the period from 2009-2010 is the most recent decrease. Hence might result into not building houses anymore.</p>

<p>Also sale price was at the peak, in the year 1995 and experienced an even worse decrease and after that it never reached it's peak. And after suffering continuous dips in sale price. They eventually might have stopped making them, after they experienced another decrease.</p>",,

In addition, I guess that the variable* 'YearRemodAdd*' means the year that the house was remodeled or had an addition performed to it. Comparing the earliest building date (1872, Melbourne was founded on 1835) with the earliest revamp (2010), it does not add up that there were no works done on any house in a city that has been economically growing throughout the last two decades (source: <a href=""http://melbourne.geografia.com.au/"">http://melbourne.geografia.com.au/</a>).

if no house built in last 9 years, i prefer little trust in the model.to use the model trained based on the data 9years ago and predict current saleprice of these houses? the inputs is unchangeble（ like XXXarea....） ,so no way to do that.
<strong>What about if it is reason #2?</strong>
we should collect more info about these house in past 9 years to  make a credible prediction.
<strong>How could you dig into the data to see which explanation is more plausible?</strong> <br>
it's easy to confirm. <br>
1. i calculate number of houses built in each year.
2. i make a window (length=9years) to slide the result from 1, and calculate the  number of houses built in these window.
So i get these: 
calculate number of houses built in each year.
<code>a=home_data.groupby('YearBuilt')['Id'].count().to_frame()</code>
prepare unknown year as 0 house built
<code>b=pd.DataFrame({'YearBuilt':np.arange(a.index.min(),a.index.max()+1),'Id':0})
b.set_index(keys='YearBuilt',inplace=True)</code>
get number of houses built in each year
<code>build_per_year = (a+b).replace(np.nan,0)</code>
make a window (length=9years) to slide the result, calculate the  number of houses built in these window.
<code>build_per_year.rolling(window=9).sum().plot()</code>

It might also reveal other ""issues"" with the dataset that we hadn't discovered, yet. </p>

<p>B) In lieu of (or in addition to) the documentation, I would step back and get to know the dataset better by familiarizing myself with all of the fields. Are there fields that can provide a clue as to when the dataset was pulled? What geographic areas are included in the data and how likely is it that 0 new homes would have been built in that area after 2010? Are there other fields that could help explain why there is no data available after 2010? Are we certain that we have ""complete"" data for the years before 2010 or do we notice an unexpected drop-off even before that? </p>

<p>I would run some descriptive statistics / basic analysis on relevant fields to help answer these questions. </p>

<p>C) In the process of exploring this issue, we're not unlikely to unearth other questions about the completeness and reliability of the data. If so, I would look into those as well. </p>

<p>D) Once I have a better sense of the dataset's completeness and the likely reasons for any gaps/issues (including the newest home in the dataset being from 2010), I would revisit the purpose of our project to determine whether this dataset can actually be used to answer the questions at hand. </p>",,

In fact the range in Year Built is way much higher (More distributed in time) than the range in YearSold (1872 - 2010). As we can also see, the maximum value of YearSold and YearBuilt is 2010, so there is more chance the data collection was just stopped in 2010. Another argument is that, for all houses really built between 1872 and 2010, those which have been sold before 2006 are not in our dataframe, meaning *<em>we are missing some data thus information, and our model will just learn patterns for houses sold in the range 2006-2010 which does not fully represent the reality *</em>(There might have been an economic crisis in this period, or a law on real estate affecting house prices). So the variable YearSold should be well distributed in time.

There are few things and current ongoing pattern along with historic data.

This can be explained by the end of the data collection process or maybe that the data-set we use is simply out-dated. </p>

<p>I believe the important question here is whether or not this is problematic. Bottom line, we are trying to predict future home prices. In order for our predictions to be accurate, the data needs to represent the future in the best way possible. This also requires us to go on Google and research a little bit. Did anything important happen to Real Estate prices in that area since 2010? </p>

<p>For example, if we had data up to 2006 and I would have wanted to predict a home price in 2010, that would be a huge mistake, as plenty happened to Real Estate in America during those years - and my model would not be able to take that into consideration.</p>

<p>To conclude, it's always risky to predict outside of the scope of your model (different years, different types etc), but the important part is to be aware of the issue, and understand where your model might be skewed, and in which direction. In this example, if a lot happened in Real Estate since 2010 (and not just regular inflation) I would avoid trying to predict a 2019 home using this model. I would, however, gladly predict a 2010 home price that was not seen by the model. It is crucial to understand your model's limits and not try to over-reach. </p>

Under this assumption which actually is consistent to the basic economic theory, the actual price that anyone will pay for a new house will be lower than what the data and the model based on it will predict in this oversupply housing market. But it may be possible to capture the downward pricing trend in the data for recently built houses if you model well or we can simply acknowledge that the prediction will have an upward bias.  In a way, it is naive to believe that the housing price can be predicted using hedonic regression data when we are clearly aware that that the housing market is severely dependent on the overall macro economy. In the data rich environment, we should not even try to predict the house prices only using the characteristics of the house.</p>",,

    1. gives only stats of each column which might not be useful as such (like mean ID, std ID, mean MoSold, std MoSold….)
2. If we look at the <strong>raw data</strong>
    1. A cursory look at listing of columns 
         1. does not seem to indicate when the data was collected.
         2. this appears to be filtered data : no zipcode, no latitude longitude, no city or town 
             1. Is this the way data is reported in US - note: Melbourne data has Postcode, Latitude, Longitude
    2. Range of YrSold+MoSold is monthly from 200601 to 201007. 
        1. No month is missed for SALES in this range
    3. Let us take counts of samples of years 2006 to 2010
        1. YearBuilt counts
            1. 2006 - 67

            1. Assumption : data of New Builds &amp; Remodel /Additions stopped around the same time also (we need additional month data to be sure)
        3. We could safely rule out space constraints in Iowa
    6. <strong>Need more data</strong> (and need to learn more data science techniques) before conclusion
        1. Why is there no data after 2010 July
            1. Month data needed also for New Builds &amp; Remodel /Additions
        2. Deeper study may be needed
            1. Need Zipcodes, town, or Lat long data for this data set
            2. Need to look at each of the fields in detail and understand their meaning

data decreased significantly so it has big probability  the data isn't complete. But maybe, the 2010's data is complete because some reasons, such as economic crisis. </p>

<p><strong>SHORT PEEK AT THE DATA:</strong>
Looks like building in Iowa stopped sharply between 2006 and 2010, after a pretty crazy peak. Maybe they moved to apartment buildings? Let's take a closer look.

<p>Yep. After a creazy boom in 2005 - 2006, building of houses started to drop rapidly to almost none in 2010.
Now, let's look at the demand.
<img src=""https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3564129%2Fdd7a329ea55b01ee47dc3ebe57b811d4%2FBuilt%20Houses%20in%20Iowa%202000-2010.PNG?generation=1565788556207105&amp;alt=media"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Well look at that, who doesn't looove a cute looking graph? July is the most favourite month to buy out of all! And the seasonality of the data is outstanding,  except for 2010. It looks that starting June, the trend in seasonality is waaay different than what we've seen before. What are the chances of such a big disruption in the data to happen organically? Maybe the prices have gotten way too far?
Also, pretty weird that, although we have been building houses from 1972, sold data is starting from 2006 onwards.

<p>Nope, looks like average sale prices have actually decreased in the last 3 years. This should mean people buying more, and when demand rises, supply has room to rise to. So, it should be pretty affordable as a Real Estate investor to put some cash into making more houses.

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong>
So maybe it really is a gap in the data. From a little search on the Googles, it doesn't look like something major happened in Iowa in 2010. And with the economy rising so fast in the last years, it would be pretty weird that people didn't find ANY room to build in the state. 😅 </p>",3.0,02/20/2021

I just started learning about machine learning thanks to Kaggle. </p>

<p>To answer the questions I would say that having very old data can be a problem because extrapolating data from a model can get to wrong conclusions.  In this sense,  old data won't represent the latest trendings of the city. For example, what happens if now everybody wants to live in Iowa and the prices of the houses have increased in a higher rate in the last 5 years? or if security concerns in Iowa are higher in the last 7 years and now everybody is selling the houses? </p>

<p>I think it is important to have data as updated as possible and in the case is not an option, it is important to clarify the constrains  of the model.</p>",,

Therefore, it makes sense that the data was collected a long time ago and the houses built since then don't show up. To fully discard the possibility that they haven't built new houses, I think it would be necessary to check with authorities in Iowa and inquiry about more updated data. It's also worth considering that in case they haven't built new houses, there is a reason for that, and that reason has to be taken into account when creating a prediction model, since it would likely affect transaction prices. </p>

<p>If the dataset is not up to date, is that a problem? As many have said already, depends on the purpose. But it's true that, if we are building a machine learning model to predict the most accurate possible transaction prices for the houses, we need updated data. With the data we have right now, we will achieve results that reflect historical prices up to 2010.

1) Data is old.
2) Data could be deleted.
3) Data is proper and that is all about, that means no more houses built.
How are they affect our model?
If we try to estimate any new building's price(2 years old), it could be wrong because dataset hasn't new buildings or dataset is old or wrong, so our price must be old or wrong too right? So what can we do of course We can collect more data and check for errors but maybe we don't need to check for a new dataset, This is the solution I think about:
<code>What could affect a house's price and how they affect prices?</code>
We will look for price's changes in scale of %, for example, We have one building with price 100k and another building with price 120k only thing that changes location of houses so we can say location affect price %20.  To do that we can define one base price with the help of average and std then we can check changes in price. And again we need more information about today's prices but with less information, we can estimate more houses.

For sure we are not going to build a model for resolving a problem in past, otherwise such dataset with the newest house in 2010 would be an ideal dataset with more than eighteen thousand records, unless such dataset would be used in joining with another dataset that includes data from 2010 to 2019 to build an ML model for predicting house prices in lowa.  </p>",,

What do you think explains this?</strong>
&gt; Lack of data after 2010
<strong>How could you tell if you are right?</strong>
&gt; Examining other time variables should help in getting some initial hint: YearRemodAdd and YrSold 
&gt; If no more houses built after 2010, there should be Remod houses present on the data or at least Sold houses.
&gt; As there are no remod nor sold houses after 2010, it is very suspicious that the data continues after 2010. 
&gt; Most likely it is that the dataset was in fact collected in 2010. 
&gt; Anyway we could also though about something critical, like contamination in the area,
&gt; and for that reason there  were no more houses built, remod or sol. 
&gt; But this is very unlikely, unless data is from a place like Tchernobyl. But data is not from there, so only the lack of
&gt; data seems to be a reason that can account for this fact.
&gt; We shoud rule out the contamination problem with other data source, like local news and then 
<strong>Is that a problem?</strong>
&gt; It depends on wether we need a price prediction for today. In that case, as of 2019, a time series of prices for 2010
&gt; and earlier prices will not be much useful.
&gt; But, as I saw below published by Maurice Dorvelus  (<a href=""https://www.kaggle.com/mshariat121"">https://www.kaggle.com/mshariat121</a>) there is a great
&gt; seasonality that is indeed very usefull as a predictor of relative price levels. So, from that point of view is not
&gt; a big problem.</p>",,

<p>What do you think explains this? 
How could you tell if you are right?
Is that a problem?</p>

<p>It looks like the data is incomplete and following are some points for consideration before embarking on designing models with such data anomalies 
1) Specific source system that collects data stopped working. This scenario is highly unlikely assuming such systems are crucial for the governance of  the state. 
2)Data is from old system and new system in place for data post July 2010, but the data sources and/or application systems are not integrated to have a common data repository
3)This could just be a subset of the data set for experimentation or verification. In case complete data is not available  prediction based on such partial data  should have the underlying assumptions and risks published for further usage of both data and  ML models.  There should be specific reference to risks regarding the error in predictions that can get into the model, in case we adopt extrapolation or regression  post 2010. This is because for each subsequent year  there is no target (labels or observations from the real world ) values  to improve the model parameters based on supervised learning
4)Even though there is only new house built  in 2010 July, it doesn't mean that housing related activities got stopped completely.  The average housing price in 2010 is not significantly different from that of the previous year, basically housing scene is not that discouraging. Just one house got newly built in the first 7 months of  2010 is fairly possible due to reasons like lack land or due to construction specific regulations. Only 6 house got re modified in 2010  can also be a  possible scenario, due to stricter rules in issuing loans for re modification.  However 175 houses  got sold in 7 months of 2010, which is some what closer to  the previous years picture
5)Since the target variable for prediction, Sales price, is not available for records prior to  year 2006, either remove such records before training the model or fill with default values . But this can greatly impact accuracy of  model parameters like weights, adversely</p>

<p>In summary going ahead with a model trained using  the given data set  will greatly undermine the effort to take the housing price prediction in 2019 closer to reality  for both home buyers and sellers impacting the economy of the city, including  citizen trust in information systems</p>",,

There is no problem in the Model if no new houses where made.
In case 2

A cause could be they did not have the need to expand, maybe new families were not moving into that area or that area is not expanding and growing, or they did not need to expand anymore. Perhaps there is no land available at the time or resources to build newer houses. And because the location is not a feature in this dataset, I guess we can also assume maybe people are moving into apartments more(?)  Perhaps the  economy was not good after 2010, so we can also maybe assume around this time gas prices are high(?)</p>

<p>I dont know how I can tell if my assumptions are correct, or if they are going in the right direction.

2010: area_A ~= 2*area_B ~= 3*area_C

Just looking at the data as presented and if I knew that new houses have not been built in the area represented over the period of the newest house, then #1 would increase my trust of the model.   If I just knew they ""hadn't built houses where the data was collected."", then I would still trust the data but if possible would seek to validate timeframe.   Also, it would depend what metrics were being requested generated from the dataset.  For instance, if the lot size was to be used for a city-wide comparison, then the age of the data set would not be affected.   But in either case, I would use the summary metrics if presented with #1</p>

<p>With #2, it would depend on what the summary metrics are being used for.   So, my trust of the data-set would be not affected or lessened depending again on use of summary.</p>

<p>To Dan's questions above, the fact that the homes listed are several years old does not cause me alarm because lots of data is collected at a frequency of years.  For instance, this information could have collected as a part of a project many years ago.  If the data needed refreshing, estimates could be generated using trends, etc.</p>

<p>What explains the age of the data?  Many reason, i.e. data is collected during a census year.</p>

<p>If no new homes have been built there has been no growth in the city. It is less likely that it is sitting at equilibrium and more likely that people are leaving/selling. As the model contains this information it should predict a decrease in housing prices up to now (2019). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, as we can see at 2006, things can happen to alter the trends. As we know, the economy begins to recover eventually, so the downward trend will change. We can expect that house prices now increase every year. The data does not contain information required for the model to predict this.</p>

<p>The model only contains sale data from 2006-2010; a 4-year window of house sales will not be correct 9 years later! </p>

<p>Not only are there no new homes built in the data set, but there are also no new homes sold! If indeed no new houses had been sold since 2010 then we could safely say that the houses are worth next to nothing, and some very unlucky people are doomed to live in this city forever unless they have the money saved to move elsewhere.</p>

<p>Option 1. Data is not old. Houses are worth $0. Obviously not the case. </p>

<p>Option 2. Data is old. The 4 year  window of house sales (2006 to 2010) will never be enough to predict house prices today, and it is most likely that it would predict that prices have fallen every year from 2006 for all properties unless people downsised after the bubble burst, in which case the cost of small properties would probably surpass that of larger ones int he models output.</p>

<p>The model might give us insight into how people shift to lower value properties after a housing crash. It would be a useful model to use to make more informed financial decisions next time a bubble bursts.</p>",3.0,10/10/2019

For a plot to have been stagnant since 2010, that would mean the plot was never put up for sale until 2019, meaning houses nobody wants to buy.

- Just check the dataset collection date. If it is not written we can verify with other sources. Ex. Just find in the internet a new building constructed later that has homes and the data is not up to date.
Is that a problem*
- If you imagine  being in 2010 and drawing conclusions for the home market at the moment it can be a valuable source of information.

It might be that it is complete in these years, it might be that parts of it are fake, it even might be that due to whatever reason the data from 2006 shows misses more values than that from 2010. Who knows? If you have no background on how the data was collected, all you can do is try to find reasoning to check if the data appears legit or not. In this case, at least for the newer data we actually know that there was a housing rush in the US in the early 2000s, so these many new-build houses make sense. Furthermore, the market crashed from 2008, so the drastic decrease also makes sense. Considering that house-building usually takes a while, it appears reasonable that the drop-off is not steep but somewhat gradually.</p>

<p>Regarding the hypotheses: Yes, it makes sense to try to neutral on building assumptions, but in this case you can be quite certain that the issue is that no further data was collected, not that there were no new houses in Iowa for more than 9 years.</p>

<p>One further thing about the pricing plot: Showing the ""average sale price"" over time does not show anything, definitely not if prices decreased or not.  First, the difference between the minimum and maximum are clear below 10% and you have no knowledge on the features of the houses. Given the low sample size for later years, you cannot assume that you cover an ""average"" house, so producing averages over the size or maybe the most important feature of your prediction model would make more sense. Furthermore, you should never cut your axes!

<p>Many of you have mentioned that you can interpolate prices, etc. by looking at the trend. I am not agreeing or disagreeing to the fact but let us consider the following issue:
If we had to comment about the size of the porch/wood deck in Iowa houses, it would be fallacious to base our answers on housing data from the year 2010 and earlier. It is possible that modern houses tend to have larger wooden decks and so, our analysis would be skewed by the fact that we have incomplete (or not up-to-date) data.</p>

Here's why it makes a big difference - Up until 2008 consumers were able to take mortgages with terrible credit, and this obviously affected how the houses were being priced, you see, they were being artificially inflated, and it's only in 2009-2010 that the economy began to recover, and this data does not unveil the modern housing patterns that reflects a market where people with horrible credit cannot get sizeable mortgages.</p>",,

<p>As most people have already said, I think the best reason why the newest houses listed in the Iowa data are from 2010 is that the data is indeed outdated. </p>

<p>How could you tell if you are right?    </p>

<p>There is some evidence (which follows from the data) that supports the previous claim. According to the data, (a) the latest houses have been built in 2010, which is quite unlikely. (b) The latest remodeling has been made in 2010, which is more unlikely. Finally, (c) the last time a house has been sold was in 2010, which is even more unlikely.

<p>Is that a problem?</p>

<p>It depends on what you want your model to do with such data. I really don’t find it a problem <em>per se</em>. i think data is neutral, that is, it’s information about a domain of reality that has the potential to provide value knowledge. What makes a dataset good or bad for predicting depends on what you want to predict. Besides, I think datasets are relative. That is, if a particular piece of data is not going to work for predicting current values, it might eventually do so by adding further data or making deeper analyses -for instance, by comparing Iowa data with data from others locations (say, New York) during the same period of time, and then estimating the evolution of the former based on the evolution of the latter.</p>",3.0,09/09/2018

So, it seems odd that while more than 50% houses in an area are remodeled in a 16 year period, there is zero remodeling in the next 8 years. This shows that the data is only available till 2010 and not after that.
Also looking at the overall quality and condition columns, it seems that 25% of the houses have 5 or lower rating on a scale of 1-10. Now if we assume that rating of 1 represents worst and 10 represents the best quality and condition, a quarter of the houses in this data have below average quality and condition. By inverting the scale, this number of below average houses goes up to 75%. So, it seems that there are quite some houses that are in apparent need of remodeling which further proves that if there was data beyond 2010, we would probably have seen some more remodels with max value of that column to be a date later than 2010.

<h2>1. What do you think about the fact that all homes listed in the Iowa data are several years old?</h2>

<p>I think it could affect the trust in the model built with this data if one is trying to model more recent homes that are newer or more recent. In other words, the model may have less fidelity for recent houses/homes in Iowa. </p>

<h2>2. What do you think explains this? How could you tell if you are right?</h2>

<p>I believe the data was just collected a while ago (near 2010/2011).</p>

<p>One way to see this is to look at histograms of the data with year values (YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd,  GarageYrBlt, YrSold). If the histograms are right skewed (with a right tail), then it could be possible where newer houses were being built/sold/remodeled less frequently in the area. If the histograms are not right skewed (more uniform/flat or left skewed), then #2 becomes more likely where the data was collected sometime near 2010 with no data on houses after that.</p>

<p>Looking at the histograms/distribution of the data, it looks like the year data is either close to uniform (YrSold), or is mostly left skewed (YearBuilt, GarageYrBlt, YearRemodAdd). This points to the data being collected a while ago since there is an 'abrupt' stoppage of data at the more recent years.</p>

<h2>3. Is that a problem?</h2>

<p>This would most likely be a problem, but it depends on what one is trying to do with the data. If one is trying to model Iowa homes during the era the houses were built/remodeled/sold, then the 'old' data may not pose too many issues and may actually be ideal; however, if one is trying to model more recent houses/homes trends, then this data may have less fidelity since it would be outdated as mentioned earlier.</p>

To determine if it would be a problem or not would mean one would need to examine the ""consistency"", that is if a house with very similar features sells for a very similar price irrespective of the years. The approach would need to in cooperate the current equivalent of the currency for each particular year a house was sold so as not ensure the prices gotten are of equal values. After this the data can be grouped based on houses with similar metrics and then plotting histograms for each of the groups.

Housing prices generally don't change very much over 5 years, but they can change a lot over 10 years. On the other hand, our model will be trained by 1,460 samples, and it will be able to determine whether each feature adds or detracts from the overall sale price, and be able to make an educated guess at a price.

<li>What do you think about the fact that all homes listed in the Iowa data are several years old. What do you think explains this?</li>
</ol>

<p>The most obvious explanation is that the dataset was compiled in 2010 (the date of the newest house) - This could be corroborated by cross referencing with a simple search for say planning permission applications for new houses being built in Iowa. It is possible that no new houses have been built, but it would seem unlikely.</p>

<p>In short, we would seek another data source to corroborate our primary source.</p>

<ol>
<li>How could you tell if you are right ?</li>
</ol>

<p>As above cross referencing with land registry or openly available government data sources, alternatively looking at house selling websites which indicate when houses were built</p>

<ol>
<li>Is that a problem?</li>
</ol>

<p>It is only a problem IF there were no new houses built. If there were then our pricing data is dated and needed to be appended with a newer source of information. Most house pricing websites update their data daily, so we would need to design a script to fetch new data to append to our existing records.</p>",,

<p><strong>Second Data</strong></p>

As far as problems are concerned, there are a few things to consider.  The data may not be problematic if the housing market in Iowa was very consistent and there were not significant evens that occurred in the market to cause a change (i.e. a real estate crash like we had in 2008).  If the market is very consistent, then the only thing that would need to be done would be to depreciate appropriately for the uncounted 8 years.  We would also need to adjust for inflation over the past 8 years as well.  However, the only way to know if there were any changes in the market over the past 8 years would be to analyze more data (which we apparently cannot get) so while at first glance, it may not seem that not having all the data MAY not be so bad, the reality is that we wouldn't know if not having the data is bad without getting data proving that it isn't bad (oh the irony!).  </p>",,

<p>my answer:

on the surface it suggests that the last year buit was 2010 but  it is 2009 ,whenever the remodeling year is not present 
it was filled with year built.</p>

<p>home_data[home_data['YearBuilt']!=home_data['YearRemodAdd']].groupby('YearBuilt')['YearBuilt'].count().sort_index(ascending=False)</p>

<p>The maximum year is 2009 ,atleast remodeling should be going on if the houses are not built but even the remodeling year has to be there for few 
even the sold year is also only in these below 5 years,atleast these should have been after 2010.

<p>I think if the area indeed has no new homes built after 2010 (which is obvious from the data set, and you actually need to check it in some other way), it means that the old houses are possibly being a) remodelled and b) resold. I would think that in this case you can use your model built on this old data (it's the same houses). 
However, if new houses are built  in the area (possibly more modern, different materials and energy distribution), then it is less rebliable to use the model built on old data to do the prediction on the new houses.</p>

<p><strong>How could you tell if you are right?</strong>
We are speaking of 8 years (now 2018; newest house 2010) without new houses. We could investigate the house building trend in the house building years before 2010. I personally like the approach to look at the percentiles for this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Swetha wrote</strong>
  However other data summary parameters state otherwise. Looking at percentiles of year Built, 25% of the homes are built in the last 10 years of the data compared to 25% of homes built in the previous 30 years. This shows that there is a definite increase in the demand for homes during those 10 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, we can't be sure, that there was no anomaly that suddenly prohibited new houses. We also observe that we have just sales between 2006 and 2010, so there are no new houses built and no old houses are sold after 2010, that would require a higher anomaly to explain. It is more reasonable to assume an old dataset.</p>

<p><strong>Is that a problem?</strong>
House prices depend on the economy. Changes in the economy lead to changes in house prices. If the data is really 8 years old, it might be too old to predict house prices nowadays. Our sales are done between 2006 and 2010, so we also can't reliably predict the trend in house prices to balance this error.</p>",,

So we can say YearBuilt is likely a leading variable for YrSold.  Unfortunately we cannot verify this because of a lack of data, so it is only a hypothesis.  </p>

<p>What else is likely true is there is downward pressure on prices because of an oversupply of houses due to the hot money flowing in between 2000-2004 which led to the massive spike.  We can verify this by looking at average price overtime, month over month.  It turns out that prices remain somewhat stable throughout indicating that there is either a delayed effect, prices are sticky in the housing market, or the decrease in demand and increase in supply are already priced into the market, because construction takes time.</p>",,

<p>The histogram would be an effective approach to see if the statement made above is right. As in this histogram for the <em>YrBuilt</em> presented by Ash S, we see that it is left skewed meaning, there were new houses being built frequently in Iowa towards the year 2010.

Only if the numbers tapered down to 0 in 2011 and there was some timestamp evidence that the list has been updated recently, would I believe the null hypothesis.  An abrupt drop to 0 in 2011 and inactivity since 2010 are consistent with the initial hypothesis that the data is stale.
This data could be extrapolated to the current date by multiplying by some factor arrived at by comparing the median and standard deviation of home prices today versus the last year of compiled data.  However, this would come with some uncertainty.
The better solution is to find a source of the same data for the missing years and insert that into the store.

If one wishes to use this data to gain some historical perspective on homes built before 2010 then this data would be perfect for them. </p>

<p><strong>What do you think explains this? How could you tell if you are right?</strong></p>

<p>The newest home was built in 2010.</p>

<p><strong>Is that a problem?</strong></p>

<p>I think this will be a problem if the data is to used to predict prices of homes today. If no new homes were built after 2010 then this data is appropriate to use but since that is unlikely then I wouldn't suggest using this data to create a model for predicting house prices.</p>",,

<ul><li>Reason #1. They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.</li>
<li>Reason #2. The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.

<li><p>What do you think explains this?  How could you tell if you are right?
First, the minimum of YrSold begins at 2006. This is different from value patterns of other features(YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd and GarageYrBlt). 
Second, the maximum of YrSold ends at 2010. It was likely that no new house would be built after 2010. But, it was not likely that no house would be traded for a long time. <br>
Third,  all the maximums of YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, GarageYrBlt and YrSold have same value, 2010.</p></li>
<li><p>Is that a problem?
It can be problem or not problem.
It is possible to predict the sale price of the other houses sold in Iowa from 2006 to 2010. 
But, it is difficult to predict the sale price of houses after 2010, regardless of new house or old house. </p></li>

<p>Answer :
If we analyse the data-set given, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd and YrSold shows latest year as 2010. 
This shows that the data was captured nearly 7 years ago and since then there was no new surey done.</p>

<p>I believe the context of the points referred in the exercise is to see whether this data good for predictive modeling? Let’s see if we can get a hint using other statistical techniques - Hypothesis testing, Inferential statistics, Regression Analysis. </p>

<p><strong>Null Hypothesis: No houses have been built.</strong>
I believe we cannot do hypothesis testing here because we cannot re-measure the data under new circumstances and then trying to reject or failing to reject null hypothesis.</p>

<p><strong>Inferential Statistics:</strong>
We need to assume that the data at hand is a sample from a large population. This hypothetical large population may have data before 1872 or after 2010, and the data at hand is just a sample. But inferential statistics can tell us about the reliability of the summary statistics through repetitive sampling. Hence, may not be of great help.</p>

<p><strong>Regression Analysis:</strong>
Let’s assume today’s Jan 2011 and we are trying to do regression to find expected number of houses in 2011 using mean / year of other variables as independent variables. Then can very well use the data to train a model and then predict 2011. Combining this with inferential statistics methods like cross – validation, we may be able to get a confidence interval for number of houses expected in 2011 and for that matter in 2018 as well by just feeding back 2011, 2012, 2013... prediction as a data point itself. But as the number of years would increase, our prediction will start accumulating errors from each year and will be less and less reliable. </p>

<p>We can use a similar design to predict, let’s say, prices of houses. But as the years will pass by, 2011 – 2018, we will accumulate errors from each year and model will be lesser reliable.</p>

<p><em><strong>Hence, my conclusion</strong></em> would be that data is great for predictions in 2011, not so much for 2018. And we may be able to use regression analysis to get a hint whether building houses stopped after 2010.   </p>",1.0,02/20/2020

<p>Since the purpose of the exercise that leads to this discussion is to familiarize with the data through panda's describe() function, I will naively refer only to what can be noticed by examining the data summary. Excluding the field YearBuilt, there are two more date fields, YearRemodAdd and YrSold, where the max value is 2010. This alone strongly suggests that the data are outdated, as it is highly unlikely that for the past 8+ years no houses have been remodeled or traded at all.</p>

<p>Is that a problem?</p>

<p>In a real world estate project that would be a problem. The credibility of the data should have to be externally verified before inference techniques are applied, as preparing and manipulating the data is a time consuming procedure, and the cost for an inaccurate prediction big.
On the other hand, in an academic scenario, the data might have been appropriate for calculating the weights of the factors that govern the price of houses, and then potentially readjusted to fit newer values.</p>",2.0,08/15/2019

<p>First I wanted to see if there is any importance of the 'YearBuilt' variable to the 'SalePrice' because, if there is none, I think the final ML model that we would build will have no effect regardless whether we have data after 2010 or not. But as we all can imagine, there <em>DOES exist a relationship</em> among these two variables, therefore, any loss of data on the houses built after 2010 will cause our final model to perform worse. (so if it was the second case i.e., <em>""The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up""</em> — that is definitely going to affect our model)

<p>And speaking of the first point, if we are to believe that after 2010, no more houses were built, I had a rough look at the number of houses built on year and it does seem to fluctuate, but with an overall increasing trend. (Interesting observation here is the sudden drop of houses built within last 4 years -- does this signals that there will be no more new houses built in lowa? :/)</p>

<p>Therefore, we can assume that, there must have been new houses built after the last data point on this data-set and they have not being included in.

The overall  real estate market in Iowa is  stable. Even some bad things might happened which would have side effect to the  marketing, it is still small probability that the numbers tapered down to 0. Especially this extremely scenario kept almost 8 year.
This could  be a problem if we directly use the model base on this data set to predict recent years' Iowa real estate status. I think it is OK if only to predict the status from last half year of 2016 to first half year of 2017 for there exists pattern in  Iowa real estate sales</p>",,

771880,678369,60581,1914507,11/21/2019 09:36:19,,"<p>Final Conclusion:
1) I would go with Reason 2 - Looks like data was collected sometime in the second half of 2010.  so no data is available for houses built or sold after 2010. There were 175 houses sold in 2010 but the last 4 years shows a consistent trend of sales of more than 300 houses every year. </p>

<p>2) It would always be best to have data of the recent sales to make best predictions. But I would still trust a model built on this data to some extent as it contains data of sale of houses built since 1872 till 2010. So it already takes into consideration the gap between built year and year of sale for a very good number of years. </p>

<p>Explanation : 
Looking at the YearBuilt in isolation gives an impression that the number of houses built (and sold) after 2006 is decreasing from highest in 2006 (67) to lowest in 2010 (1 house). Since there is a gradual decrease there could be a possibility that no houses were built after 2010. I do not think this is the case here.</p>

<p>This is a data of Sales of Houses, so instead of looking at the YearBuilt of the house it would be more appropriate to first look at the year of sale of the houses (YrSold). This is NOT a data set of all the houses built in any given year so just because it does not have any data of houses built after 2010 does not mean there were no houses built. We can only conclude that no houses were sold which were built 2010 or later at the time of collection of this data. </p>

<p>We can see that this data set has data only for houses sold between 2006 to 2010 ( with information about when they were built). </p>

<p>Looking at the bar graph (attached &amp; hopefully visible to all after posting) which shows number of houses by Year of Sale, it is clear that the sales were consistent from 2006 to 2009. The sale is less in 2010 but this could be because the data was collected before the year 2010 ended. There is no data of Houses built after 2010 and also no data for houses sold after 2010, together this suggests that data was collected only upto 2010. </p>

The data we are using (from Iowa) are outdated, because we have information only until 2010. This means that we need to have in mind when we want to generate our model to predict future sales.

<p>How this would affect the model??
My reasoning is that the scenario that new houses have been built would be worse for the model than the data being old. 
My reasoning is that if there exist a universe where no new houses need to be built( somewhere magical where population doesn't increase) the data might be up to date and our modelling wont be wrong</p>",,

See the data, minimum year buid is 1872 but minimum year sold is 2006, The difference between minimum year build &amp; minimum year sold is too high.

If this is not the case, that states that they haven't built and sell any houses in last 9 years. In this scenario old data will not help to sell any new houses because in last 9 years none of the houses are sold and price prediction will not lead to sell the houses.</p>

<p>Now more likely case, in last 9 years we didn't collected any data. But in 9 years a world has been changed. We need to verify our prediction with new houses sold. We might need to add some scaling to predict prices and we might done and may be not.

Since this modelling exercise is all about predicting home prices using data ending up to this period it would be very likely that models built using only this data will most likely predict very biased house prices. In my opinion housing markets take a long time to build up but take a very short time span to correct. What is missing in this dataset is the period when the steady state of the corrected inflation adjusted price post 2008-2009 crisis is reached.

Financial and Infrastructural growth 
It is more likely that to fulfil the demand there should have been new houses built after the newest house recorded in our Dataset.  Our Dataset has records of houses built from 1872 -2010 and houses sold 2006-2010. Then where did these people from population growth and Immigration leave?

Yes, our model has been trained to predict the price based on the then requirements of the people looking for the house, which our old Dataset holds.
But with the growth in Infrastructure and Technology people demands have changed. Now people not only look for houses as per the size but also look for infrastructural growth in the area and in the near and far surrounding area to it. And also what amenities are provided when buying a new home.
So our model prediction may prove wrong with changes in environment and requirements.</p>

<p>An easy way to check if this assumption is right could be just check any online realstate web. Their data should be up to date. Or check with the local authority. At least in Spain we have the ""Catastro"", bureau that control the buildings legaly existing (to charge taxes).</p>

I don't expect it. The type of houses change adapting to the people necessities. And I don't thinkl that 10 years is time enough to change noticibly this.

In either case, the increase in price could either mean  there is greater demand, but no new homes are being built, or it could be acting as an incentive for businesses to build new homes to deal with the growing demand.

Even if this data set seems to be relatively old, couldn't one nevertheless estimate the price of older houses (built between 1950 and 2000)?
If we take a hypothetical situation that no construction,renovation or the price fluctuation due to numerous factors such as population increase,standard of living in that locality increase etc was done in 10 years time(as of my writing) then it`s possible to predict prices of the houses based on old data.</p>

<p>But it`s not possible.As the time passes population increases.With time wants of people changes. Newer developments happen in the locality such as malls,hospitals,banks,supermarkets etc.Newer houses get built.Renovations take place.These all factors increase the price.</p>

<p>However, there are no sales and no completed builds after 2010 which makes it really hard to say that some factor just stopped the housing market. Sure, the financial crisis took place but there have certainly been many homes built and sold in the 10 years since then. </p>

This is not an appropriate reason as even if there is no new house being build there are other properties to be sold.  Also on googling the recent Melbourne area real estate sites they show an active buying and selling history even after 2010.  Thus this reason is not as good as the other one.
- <em>The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</em>
This is somehow correct but using this we can only predict buying or selling price from 1872 to 2010 and nearby years. Real state prices did change a lot in the last decade. </p>",,

<li><code>They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.</code>
This reason goes against the argument <code>""The newest house in your data isn't that new""</code> because this reason literally says that <code>""The newest house in your data is in fact the newest!""</code> Also, for out of the houses built between 1872-2000, 25% of them were built between 2000-2010.</li>
<li><code>The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</code>
The data says that the last time a house was built was in 2010, the last time remodelling was added was in 2010 and the last time a house was sold was in 2010. Since it is currently 2020, it is highly likely that the data was collected a long time ago and therefore houses built after this data collection wouldn't show up, so the newest house in the data isn't that new.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>If the reason is explanation #1 above, does that affect your trust in the model you build with this data? What about if it is reason #2?</code>
Because the reason is #2, I would not trust my model at all. Reason: The min value of YrSold column is 2006 and all the 1460 values for that column are present. This means that all the 1460 houses have been sold at least once between 2006 and 2010. Also, 50% of the remodelling done was in just 16 years out of total 60 years (remodelling started in 1950 according to data). Therefore, with probable new houses and a lot of remodelling additions, the model built with the given data would give huge difference in results when compared to current trends. Again, the change in economy in the past 10 years plays a role!</p>

<p><strong>Correct Explanation:</strong><br>
As per the data set, we can see that the last YrSold and YearRemodAdd are also 2010. So from this, we can conclude that any that both explanations can be possible.</p>

<p>As Francisco mentioned, interesting analysis can be done to understand why new homes weren't built. For example, a social phenomenon like gentrification includes other variables like price changes in rent, class conflicts, avg income shift, etc. can be reasons as to why new homes weren't built or homes that were possibly built after 2010 were not captured in this publication. Similar to Sharath comment, the area could have reached its peak of development (limited on space or there is comfortability in what and how much is invested in an area).</p>

The COVID-19 crisis significantly impacted the residential real estate market, with a steep downturn this spring and a sharp rise in prices now (<a href=""https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/fourth-quarter-2020/impact-covid-residential-real-estate-market"" target=""_blank"">source 1</a>, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/upshot/home-prices-explaining-frenzy.html"" target=""_blank"">source 2</a>).

Also even if we consider that due to some reason the construction of houses were stopped, it doesn't explain why the max value of the ""<strong>YrSold</strong>"" column indicates that the most recent house sold in that area is in year 2010, as it is very rare that housing sales in that are would just come to halt for an entire decade.</p>

The detailed explanations just on the previous comment so I will not explain it. But I want to mention the idea about how can we still use this outdated dataset to predict the house price. It is possible to predict the price after 10 years. Since it can be a year series data, the median or mean price of each year can be extracted. With the inflation rate data, the prediction of median or mean price of 2020 is possible so that it can predict the various kinds of houses in 2020 with this dataset.</p>",,

It is unlikely that sales have stopped or new houses are not being built in Iowa.  Simple research on the Internet would confirm this fact.  If the goal of the model is to predict price for a home given these features and we cannot collect more recent data, then perhaps we could build some sort of timeseries model to predict the house prices with the same features, in today's prices. Or to keep it simple, we could just adjust the predicted price based on inflation rates.  If we do this though, we have to document this with our model.  My other concern would be changing preferences in homes. For example, perhaps 10 years ago having more rooms was cool, but today, is it so? Perhaps consumers like open plan homes better now, or we don't like to have fire places unless it is a gas/electric fireplace because of environmental concerns.</p>",,

<p>Firstly.I want to say sorry for my bad english because of I'm turkish but ı can say how to predict 'SalePrice' 2020,or maybe until 2030.</p>
<p>As we investors when we invest companies 'true values', we are using discounted cash flow.So maybe we can do this method in this DataFrame.</p>
<h1>Discounted Cash Flow : It is the discounting of future cash generated by the company to today.</h1>
<p>So, We can look at home 'SalePrice' and dependent variables affecting 'SalePrice'.</p>
<h1>I can give this method name 'Discounted Anything SalePrice Method'</h1>
<p>İf we can make true models to predict correctly (2020 'SalePrice' and dependent variables affecting to 'SalePrice' values).(with 2010 values) (same thing with discounted cash flow,you must understand that method.)</p>
<p>For do it :</p>
<p>1-You must look 2010 and before 2010 'SalePrice' values and how many has increased for a year ? For example : For a year always it has increased %10 as mean.</p>
<p>2-And you can look dependent variables affecting 'SalePrice' for consolidation it.İt is your decision. </p>
<h1>(Maybe You have to try it 100 times.I don't know.Maybe you will do 100 times,change your model.İt can be hard)</h1>

<p><strong>Likely explanation:</strong> The data is outdated. Spliced to include houses that were sold between 2006 and 2010. </p>
<p><strong>Validated by:</strong> The key date variables i.e. YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, YrSold all max out at 2010. Even if new houses were not built, existing homeowners may have made renovations (YearRemodAdd). We could review the average time duration between renovations and estimate the likelihood of a renovation after 2010 for a given owner. Additionally, we could count the number of houses built in each year and calculate the growth trajectory. How strange that it would suddenly slow down?</p>
<p>Note that there are no null values for YrSold, meaning that every house in the database has a non-zero year attached to YrSold, thus all houses were sold. Who bought them all? Or rather, the dataset has been spliced to only include houses that were sold between 2006 and 2010.

<li>If there are no new houses being built in the area that the data was collected in after 2010 I have some doubts about the data. The houses may be in an anomalous area of some sort, so the predictions made about the house prices may not be applicable to houses in other areas. </li>
<li>If the data has not been updated since 2010 then I still have doubts about the data. A lot has happened in eleven years. Inflation may have driven house prices higher, so that the same house is worth much more today than the it was worth eleven years ago. Also, in 2010, the United States was recovering from the 2008 mortgage crisis. The financial environment back then was unique, and the focal point of the crisis was housing. Due to this, the financial environment that existed in 2010 for houses is quite unlike the one that exists today. This would mean that the housing prices the model predicts may be dramatically lower than it would predict using data gathered today. </li>

Most of the industries are live and active, so in that case, we can't use some outdated date set like what we have here from 2010 for the real state industry. It's just NOT possible that there was no sale in that area for 11 years in a row unless they demolished all the houses in that area and made something else! in that case, we don't need to do the prediction for that area for the current time :-) !

of fluctuations that can occur in the house price within this time window of missing data is probably huge.</p>
<p>Sometimes we simply do not have access to information about events even when it exists. In this case the lack of more than a decade of data on the houses sales price. The absence of this data can come from several sources and it seems  wise to investigate if the lack of data is missing at random, missing completely at random or missing not at random. After a verification through a data search about the events confirm that the data are not really available by some reason but it exist in fact because the residential neighborhood remains, a way to address this problem would be to look for similar neighborhoods data and other data sources such as economics(inflation, recession, bubbles<br>

<p>As many other colleagues commented, I also believe that the Melbourne housing dataset is not representative of current house prices in that region. There are several main reasons for this to occur:</p>
<p>Since there is no sale or construction data after 2010 and it is highly unlikely from the sales records that there will be an 11-year gap without a sale, we can assume that this dataset was not updated after the latest date. recent figure, which corresponds to July 2010.</p>
<p>Time is an important variable to take into account, especially if we wanted to carry out a temporal analysis of the price of houses and consider time as the main descriptive variable.</p>
<p>In the case of the dataset under analysis, the time up to which data were collected affects their availability since to date we are losing 11 years of valuable information, which is equivalent to not knowing anything about new buildings, parks or renovations in the area, which tends to affect the surrounding property values.</p>
<p>In addition to the above and in the midst of a pandemic, how do we consider the effect of Covid-19 in our model if we do not have data on this period? How did inflation affect house prices in the last 11 years? ?</p>
<p>Therefore, the resulting model can only generate predictions that are representative of prices up to the date where the data was collected, that is, 2010. Any subsequent use would undoubtedly be loaded with a huge bias and would not be representative of reality .. From a business perspective this means an outdated / old model and therefore if anyone intends to use it they should be aware of the above limitations and their possible consequences.</p>

This information isn't exactly conclusive especially since we do not know what the area really looks like. Does it mean there are no empty plots? Looking at the data, I can see that there are long time differences between the years houses were built. There were intervals of over 10 years. And since I cannot conclusively understand why houses were built at 10 year intervals, this is not a data I would trust.</p>
<p>""The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.""<br>
It is also a possibility that the data is limited by the data collection period. This is especially because no year is above 2010.

<p>But it's not a problem for our model of houses classification and for our predict application!</p>
<p>There is a constant dependency between rooms count or houses area (or etc.) and houses cost. <br>
If we take a sequence of houses of the same building age, we can split this sequence for some groups. <br>
So, we can have a group of most expensive houses (which include a houses with most rooms count or most houses area or etc.), a middle houses cost group and a cheapest houses one.<br>
I mean that we can make a sequence of rules, which determines the group for each house (for the same age houses).</p>
<p>But what can we do with a houses cost, which is not actual for our classification model?</p>
<p>Why don't we think about some coefficient of dependency between houses age and houses cost. Certainly, this coefficients value will be different for each group of our houses classification.</p>
<p>And the houses cost values from our dataset can come in handy in this action. As a result, we will have a sequence of coefficients for each group of our houses classification. For example, if a one-bedroom house aged 10 years costs N dollars, a similar house aged 11 years costs 1.2<em>N, a similar house aged 12 years costs 1.4</em>N (of course, the formula for calculating the coefficient may be more interesting), we can find the coefficient of the dependence of the houses value on its age for each houses group.</p>

<p><strong>Why are all the homes several years old?</strong><br>
The most plausible explanation for this is that the dataset we are working with is very old and hasn't been updated since 10 years. The newest house in the dataset is 10 years old. And the last sale was made 10 years ago. It is very less likely that there were no new houses built or sold in Iowa in the past 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Problems with this old dataset:</strong><br>
An ML model built on this data would learn different patterns that affected house prices between 2006 and 2010 but that range (4 years) is small compared to how old the data is (10 years). It is possible that there were social and/or economic changes that occurred in these 10 years that caused new patterns to emerge and were not accounted for by this model.</p>
<p>An example of such change could be: A social phenomenon relating to the family structure causing an increase in the number of nuclear families in Iowa (as opposed to extended families). This could lower the demand for large houses and increase the demand for smaller houses. It is possible that such a trend wasn't present in train data (2006 to 2010). </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
A model built on this data can be used to predict the old sale prices of houses in Iowa (between 2006 and 2010). But, it should not be used to predict house prices in the present day (YrSold = 2021).</p>",1.0,03/11/2021

You are right.<br>
Going by the trend you showed in the graph I feel strange that they didn't even build at least one house in the last 10 yrs.<br>

As the mean price is higher that signifies that price lot higher on house built after 2000. According to me, model trained with this data is not well trusted.  </p>",,

I totally disagree with the first statement because as you can infer from the data set and the line chart mentioned below,  despite some fluctuations, the sales prices are increasing, which means the real estate business is doing good. Moreover, even the recession period in US between 2007 to 2009 doesn't affect the prices too much at least to some extent, so there is no stopping of building new houses even after 2010.</p>

<p><strong>2.The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</strong><br>
I would consider the second statement only if my model wants to predict the sales price given a new data that falls between year 1872 to 2010 (though that's not helpful).  </p>
<p>Even though my model can predict the sales price for houses built in 2020 with the help of historical data, the accuracy would vary by a huge volume because my model did not learn the pattern from 2010 to 2020 since the data is not available. Therefore, it would go for a toss.</p>
<p>Finally, I would conclude that with this data set, we can predict the target (i.e sales price) for a new data provided YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd or YearSold falls between the year 1872 to 2010.</p>",2.0,12/14/2020

Old data is always a red flag for me, especially with something as volatile as the housing market.</p>
<p>If it is scenario one (recent data old houses), this doesn't mean the dataset is garbage, it just means that if we used it to train a model, that model would most likely NOT be effective at predicting prices of brand new houses. It WOULD however, be much more effective at predicting the prices of houses that are at least 10 years OLD in TODAY's market than data collected 10 years ago would be at predicting the prices of NEW houses on today's market.</p>
<p>Bottom line:<br>
1) If the goal is to use the data to make predictions in the present. New data is better.<br>
2) If the goal is to analyze the price of homes 10 years ago, including those of new homes, data from 10 years ago is better.</p>",,

<ul>
<li><p><strong>They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.</strong><br>
2010 was the last year that saw houses being sold or built.<br>
a. Considering factors like employment growth rate (<a href=""https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LASST190000000000003?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&amp;output_view=data&amp;include_graphs=true"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and consumer price index (<a href=""https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm"" target=""_blank"">here</a>)for Iowa, we can see that the probability of construction of new houses or selling of old houses should have increased since consumer spending capacity has also increased in the 10 years after 2020. <br>
b. If we look at this the other way around and consider this as the truth, it can speak volumes of the trends of consumer spending concerning housing that Iowa has seen since 1872 to now. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The data were collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</strong><br>
This logic seems more plausible to me because the numbers for houses built and sold jump in 2006 to 2010 and it is highly unlikely that it suddenly stopped right after. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interesting Take:</strong> Another cool thing to note here is that the jump happened while The Great Recession of '08-'09 was happening and believing that the increasing boom stopped right after 2010 when the world saw seeing a massive jump in the economy would be quite an interesting topic to converse about.)</p></li>

I agree with most of the users, there is a clear trend that prices for new poperty has been increasing, so as per demand supply rule, there would be new properties keep coming, untill there is a large surplus, where rates would start to fall down in 2008-2010, which is not seen in the attached chart.</p>",,

I see that dates (built, remodeled or addition, sold) are upto year 2010. If newest house wasn't new because no new houses are being built, then only YearBuilt would've topped off at 2010 and we'd still see more recent year values in YearRemodAdd or YrSold. Its a little hard to imagine nobody renovated or sold the house in last 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Possibility #2</strong> - The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.<br>
This is the more likely scenario as all date values in the dataframe are maxed out at year 2010. And if so, we need data from recent years for better predictions.</p>

1 - The rate of new houses reduces but never falls to zero. Also data shows houses built from a long time ago, i.e. 1900s (and some 1800s). So there are chances new houses could be built by replacing old houses. Hence 1 is very unlikely</p>

<p>-Some trends in the Iowa housing market might be volatile and change year on year, but other trends may be slower moving and/or be more predictable (e.g. perhaps increases in average selling price have followed national inflation or interest rates closely for over 150 years). </p>
<p>-The insights we might want to extract may not be for predictive purposes, but rather to set a historical benchmark for other kinds of research using other data sets (e.g. what differences can we find in the houses build between different postal codes of Iowa within a certain time range, can that tell us anything about the socio-economic situation of the people living there at the time, and can we find a correlation between those insights and other modern data sets?). </p>

While common sense can be misleading trends in data set itself show that starting from 1990 there was increasing trend of amount of houses built per year. Another proof which was also proposed by others is to check other databases with more recent information.

<p>Hi there! 👋 My name is Lucas and i recently decided to join this community. As I'm also doing the intro to Machine Learning, I thought about leaving my two cents. I hope you find it usefull!</p>
<p>Given those only two options, i decided to operate according to the classic mathematical logic procedure: <strong>negation</strong>. This methodology states that: if <strong>there is an element, included in the premise, which doesn't fullfil it</strong>, we will certainly know <strong>the premise is not true</strong> . </p>
<p>So i started digging and i found there are quite a few <em>real state webs</em> where you can actually check the price, location and even the <strong>year of construction</strong> of the houses they offer in <strong>Iowa</strong>. It took me only a few minutes to find at least one of them built <strong>after 2010</strong>, which completely <strong>invalidates the first option</strong> given.</p>

<p>We can also check when was the last time the Iowa data from DanB was updated (<strong>2 years ago</strong>), which can tell us that there is not more data being collected and added to the database from time to time or else we would have houses built post 2010. </p>
<p>This being said, i think its quite clear that the only plausible option would be the second one: <strong><em>The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</em></strong></p>
<p>Unless these data only belonged to a limited part of Iowa, which would make it necessary to verify the statements in another way…but that is another story! 😉</p>

This give a strong suggestion that the data has not been updated since 2010. And with the gap of 10 years the data available, does not seem to be effective in predicting the price of a house in 2020<br>
Another activity that can be done is to check if any newer data is available or not. <br>
If the data is not available, and even after 10 years, the prices have not changed much (say +/- 10%) then this can be factored to make a model for testing and start recording the new data in parallel. <br>
If the data is available, both can be combined to make a new model for testing. Now this decision will be based on the gap between the two years.</p>",,

<ul>
<li>is that a problem lacking last 10 years of historical series?</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Hypothesis - They haven't built new houses where this data was collected.</li>
</ol>
<p>I agreed with the approaches to try understand the context and validate the Hp - I liked the approaches of <a href=""https://www.kaggle.com/KevinHebert"" target=""_blank"">@KevinHebert</a> and <a href=""https://www.kaggle.com/FrankMathewKevin"" target=""_blank"">@FrankMathewKevin</a>. </p>
<p>Another hint I would look at YrSold  : all percentiles of houses are sold in the last years of the dataset (from 2006 to 2010):<br>
It might signal a market in high demand, with two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are not enough houses to satisfy demand</li>
<li>houses are enough to satisfy demand</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the number of houses constructed in the different percentiles shows an increasing trend, <br>
I think there are not enough houses to satisfy demand and new houses are being built in the last missing decade.</p>
<ol>
<li>The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is it a problem ? </p>
<p>To answer, I think : </p>
<p>How big ?</p>
<p>I think that since all houses shown a trend of being sold in the last few years of the datasets, no matter of how old they are, one may expect a similar trend for the last decade.</p>
<p>With which error?</p>
<p>I thought that missing the last chunk of data can be a very common problem in ML,<br>
and so I thought to train the dataset agains the first *n records - houses in the last chosen percentile *and validate against the available historical prices.</p>
<p>And then evaluate the error between forecasted prices and historical real prices, and see its trend: I might obtain still a significant value that, even if not accurate, could help in taking a decision when data is missing.</p>
<p>As example, I might compute the trending error like this :<br>
(predicted_price - real_price / real_price)</p>
<p>What do you think ?</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Why computing the percentiles like :<br>
len(home_data[(home_data[""YearBuilt""] &lt;= 1954)])</p>
<p>yields slightly different numbers than<br>
home_data.describe() </p>

A way to check this is by looking at the instance ""YrSold"", which shows us that from 2007 to 2010, houses have been being sold yearly, which is proven by the fact that the standard deviation (std) for YrSold is 1.32. Thus, for such a frequent pattern to suddenly stop at 2010, without any houses sold in the span of 10 years, could only mean that the dataset hasn't been updated since then.</p>

<ol>
<li>in order to <strong>detect faces</strong> in images (all types of faces), a dataset from 1900 or one from 2020 can lead to approx same result. Why? Well human faces are the same since Sapiens Sapiens…</li>
<li>In order to predict how much a person <strong>reads the news</strong> in 1990, we could use lots of attributes from an immaginary dataset, like the number of newspaper he buys or the number of newspaper sold in the neighbourhood. But a model built this way could never predict on some datas in 202, because people don't buy newspaper anymore and mostly uses mobile apps as newsfeed….</li>
<li><strong>Youtube</strong> automatically <strong>classifies content</strong> based on uploaded video. It constantly retrains/fine-tunes his models in order to incorporate new changes because it happened that LGBTQ+ creators filed a lawsuit claiming that YouTube’s algorithm discriminates their videos as ""sexual content"". LGBTQ+ community grew up fast in last years and basic Youtube's model did not incorporate it at first. Fairness problem arised here.</li>

A drastic change in the world economy such as the financial crisis of 2008, may change the pattern of prices. This would cause an error in the prediction of prices as well.<br>
Therefore, unless there is a drastic economic change affecting the world or the region in question, data up to 2010 should be good enough for a prediction.</p>",,
